EXERCISE 1 : "FIND THE MAXIMUM ELEMENT IN THE ARRAY"

ALGORITHMS:

PRE-CONDITION:

Start
Create a initial set of array elements, that is arr[ ] = 0
Initializing  i , temp = 0 ,
Here “i” is a variable that act in a loop for a index value and temp = 0 will be taken as a temporary value for this condition.

POST-CONDITION:

In the end of the loop condition, 
All the element in the set of array are compare with nearby element and finally resulted the maximum element of the array , using a temp value.

LOOP-VARIANT:

In the loop,
When the array value “arr( i )”  in the given set of the array is  than the loop condition less than the temp value [ arr(i)>temp) is false ]  than the loop is stop 
And again next array element will get into the loop

LOOP-INVARIANT:

In the loop,
The array value ( i ) is greater than the previous stores array value “arr( i )”, then it is true.
That final element of the array , is taken as the maximum element .
This is the result of the given array element .
End.


PSEUDOCODE :

Int i , arr [ ] = {value}  , temp=0 ;
For
( i=0 ; i < arr.length ; i++)
{
If ( arr[ i ] > temp )
    {
       temp = arr [ i ] ;
    }
}

EXERCISE 2 : "CONVERT ROMAN LETTERS TO INTEGERS"

ALGORITHMS:

PRE-CONDITION:

Start.
Initiate a value for every roman letter which given in the list using char, integer, string.
Here using a “if – condition” assign the return value for the every given roman numerals and stores in “ r ”.
Initialize result = 0.

POST-CONDITION:

After end of the loop condition,
Every given characters  are assigned each individual values.
In result, all entered roman characters will be display as number values.

LOOP VARIANT AND INVARIANT:

Here get value for r1 and r2 (r=roman) from the if-condition.
Next, Using loop
       Compare r1 and r2 value with (r1 >= r2) condition, If this condition is true, 
then add the (r1+r2) value and get the the result and stores.
       If the condition is false, then subtract (r2-r1) value and get the result and stores.
When r1 and r2 are condition statisfied for (r1 >= r2)  , then the result (res) will be shown in output.
End.



PSEUDOCODE :

int value (char r) , n ;
{
If ( r == “ “)
     Return value();
   Return 0;
}

int romtoint( String str )
{
      int sum = 0;
for ( int i = 0; i<str.length(); i++)
{
     int r1 = value(str.CharAt(i));
if (i+1 <str.length())
{
     int r2 = value(str.CharAt(i));
if (r1 >= r2)
     {
       res = res + r1;
     }
else  
     {
        rest = res - r1;
     }
  }
else 
     {
         res = res + r1;
      }
   }
Return res;
 }
}

EXERCISE 3: "MOVES ZEROS TO THE END OF THE ARRAY"

ALGORITHMS:

PRE-CONDITION:

Start
Create the initial set of array elements, that is arr [ ] = 0
Initializing count = 0.

POST-CONDITION:

In the end of the loop condition, 
All the element in the array[ ] are splits , then all non-zero elements are order from a[0] and remaining zeroes elements are followed by the non-zeroes order at the end of the array.

LOOP VARIANT  AND INVARIANT:

In the loop conditions,
All the elements in the array are get into the loop and follow the condition (arr[i] != 0)
If this condition is true, then the non-zero elements are puts into a new array arr[ i ]. And count++ till the end of the array.
Or this condition is false, in-while condition (count=0) the zero elements are counted followed by the elements in the end of the array.
All the arr() values a get by data , finally the collected data will print in output.
At the result, in the array the non-zero elements are in right side and zero elements are in the left side of the final array.


PSEUDOCODE :

Int arr[] , count = 0
{   
 for 
{
(i = 0 ; i < arr.len ; i++)
   {
        if (arr[i] != 0)
            arr[count++] = arr[i];
    }
}
While (count <  arr.len)
    {
       arr[count++] = 0;
     }
For ( int data: arr )
  }
}


                                                                 T H E  E N D
